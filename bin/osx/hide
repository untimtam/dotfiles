# This script lets you hide a specified application, the Finder, all
# applications but the Finder, or all applications other than a specified
# application, as well as bring any application to the front or toggle
# hidden and visible applications.
# Script written by Eugene Lee, Kirk McElhearn and Simon Forster.
#
# Syntax is as follows:
#
# hide [appname]    - hides specified app
# hide -x [appname] - hides all apps but specified app; if no app is
#                     specified, Terminal remains visible
# hide -a [appname] - hides all apps but Finder; if an application is
#                     specified, it remains visible as well
# hide -f           - hides Finder
# hide -v [appname] - brings specified app to the front, whether it
#                     is hidden or visible already
# hide -t           - toggles visible/hidden apps
# hide -s           - shows all apps
# hide -q [appname] - quits specified app
#
# Applications whose names contain spaces must be quoted, i.e.,
# hide "microsoft word". This command is case-insensitive.
